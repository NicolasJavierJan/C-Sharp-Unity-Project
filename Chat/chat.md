### Background gradient color change

**I have a canvas with a panel in it. I can change the background color, but I would like for the background to be changing colors all the time, like in very old video games. How can I achieve this?**

*One way to achieve this effect is to use a script to change the background color of the panel periodically over time. Here's an example script that you can attach to your panel:*


    using UnityEngine;

    public class PanelColorChanger : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public float changeInterval = 1f; // the time interval for changing the color
        public Color[] colors; // an array of colors to cycle through
    
        private int colorIndex = 0; // the index of the current color
        private float timer = 0f; // a timer for measuring the elapsed time
    
        private void Start()
        {
            // set the initial color of the panel
            GetComponent<CanvasRenderer>().SetColor(colors[colorIndex]);
        }
    
        private void Update()
        {
            // increment the timer
            timer += Time.deltaTime;
        
            // if the timer exceeds the change interval, change the color
            if (timer >= changeInterval)
            {
                // reset the timer
                timer = 0f;
            
                // increment the color index and wrap around if necessary
                colorIndex = (colorIndex + 1) % colors.Length;
            
                // set the new color of the panel
                GetComponent<CanvasRenderer>().SetColor(colors[colorIndex]);
            }
        }
    }

*This script uses a timer to periodically change the color of the panel. You can set the changeInterval variable to control how frequently the color changes, and you can specify an array of colors in the colors variable to cycle through. The Start method sets the initial color of the panel, and the Update method updates the color based on the elapsed time.*

*To use this script, simply attach it to the panel object in your scene and set the colors array and changeInterval variable as desired.*

This was the starting point. I later asked about gradients, and it gave me this code that I ended up using:

    public Gradient gradient; // reference to the gradient asset

    void Update()
    {
        float time = Time.time % 1.0f; // keep time value between 0.0 and 1.0
        Color color = gradient.Evaluate(time);
        GetComponent<CanvasRenderer>().SetColor(color);
    }
