# Mandatory II for App Development with C#
## By Nicolas Javier Jan

### LEVELS:
There are three basic levels + a presentation page.
Level 1: **Practise.** No goalkeeper, no enemies. The player can move and push a ball to both the goalposts (did you try to score a goal against yourself?).
Level 2: **Goalkeeper.** A goalkeeper was added. It moves horizontally and upon touching the ball it will end the level.
Level 3: **Enemies**. Some enemies have been added. They move in a square (similar to table football). They do not end the level, but it makes it a little harder to push the ball and get to the goalpost easily.

### Features:
### Fun Mode VS Boring Mode:
I created a "Fun Mode" where there are flashing lights in a rainbow gradient. It's nice, but I don't want to give seizures to anybody, so the option for the "Boring Mode" has been added as well.
**Background change:** The background of the first Screen and the levels changes colors. This is done by adding a Script to the panel. By default, Fun Mode is deactivated. 
**Player Trail:** The player has a rainbow trail! The looks of the game have been heavily influenced by NyanCat.
**Story Mode:** A Story Mode has been successfully added. The Player has the button for the first level available at start. When the player makes a goal in Level 01, the game moves to Level 02, and on quit the button for level 2 is interactable. Same with level 02 to level 03.
